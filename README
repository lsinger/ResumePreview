ResumePreview
===================================

ResumePreview is an AppleScript script that allows you to save the list of documents currently open in Preview on Mac OS X. For simplicity's sake, it saves this list in a hidden text file in your home directory (~/.resumepreview). For added usefulness, the application also allows you to reload that list, opening all those documents in Preview. 

This is awesome for when you need to reboot. SafariRestore (http://sweetpproductions.com/extensions/extensions.htm) solves this for browser tabs, by the way. 

Note: ResumePreview just saves a list of paths to documents, not the documents themselves. 

You can open the script using AppleScript Editor and then, for example, run it or save it as an application that you can put into your Applications folder. I went the extra mile and found a super cute hamster icon (http://www.iconfinder.com/icondetails/15582/128/agt_resume_icon) that I applied to the application; you may of course choose your own.
